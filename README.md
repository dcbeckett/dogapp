  - `→` Right Arrow = Love

### 💡 Pro Tips:
1. **Upload High-Quality Images**: Better photos get more love!
2. **Good Lighting**: Make sure your dog photos are well-lit
3. **Capture Personality**: Action shots and expressions work great
4. **Card Stacking**: You can see upcoming dogs behind the current one
5. **Heart Burst**: Watch for the heart explosion when you love a dog!
6. **🐱 Watch Out for Cats**: We randomly sneak cats into the mix as an attention test!

### 😸 The Cat Feature:
- **Random Cats**: The app occasionally injects random cat photos from the internet
- **Attention Test**: This tests whether you're really looking at photos or just mindlessly swiping
- **Subtle Hints**: Cat cards have slightly different styling (yellow border, different filter)
- **Cat Caught!**: If you swipe right on a cat, you get a special "gotcha" animation and message
- **Separate Tracking**: Cat votes are tracked separately from dog votes
- **Just for Fun**: It's all in good fun - every animal deserves love! 🐾

### 🤖 Auto-Generated Dogs:
- **Random Dog APIs**: Uses free APIs like Dog.ceo and Random.dog for variety
- **Always Fresh Content**: Ensures there are always new dogs to swipe through
- **Quality Photos**: High-quality dog photos from curated sources
- **Fun Names**: Generated dogs get fun names like "Internet Doggo 🌐" and "Pixel Pup 🎨"
- **Subtle Indicators**: Generated dogs have a small 🤖 robot badge (barely noticeable)
- **Mixed Seamlessly**: Generated and user-uploaded dogs are shuffled together randomly
